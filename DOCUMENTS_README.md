# Documents Page - Frontend Implementation

## Overview

The documents page has been simplified and made fully functional with mock data for frontend-only development. This allows for complete testing and development without waiting for the backend API.

## Features Implemented

### ✅ Core Functionality

- **Document List View**: Display all documents with filtering and search
- **Document Upload**: Complete upload form with file selection and metadata
- **Document Management**: Delete and download documents
- **Real-time Search**: Search by document name or university
- **Category Filtering**: Filter by document type (Transcripts, Essays, etc.)
- **Status Management**: Track document status (Uploaded, Draft, Pending)

### ✅ UI/UX Features

- **Loading States**: Proper loading indicators during operations
- **Error Handling**: User-friendly error messages with dismiss functionality
- **Success Feedback**: Success notifications for completed actions
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices
- **File Type Icons**: Visual indicators for different file formats
- **Drag & Drop Ready**: Upload form ready for drag & drop enhancement

### ✅ Technical Implementation

- **TypeScript**: Fully typed with proper interfaces
- **Mock API Service**: Complete mock implementation with realistic delays
- **State Management**: React hooks for local state management
- **Form Validation**: Client-side validation for upload form
- **File Handling**: Proper file selection and metadata extraction

## File Structure

```
frontend/src/
├── pages/
│   └── documents.tsx          # Main documents page component
├── utils/
│   ├── api.ts                 # Real API functions (for future backend integration)
│   └── mockDocuments.ts       # Mock data service for frontend development
└── components/ui/             # UI components (existing)
```

## Usage

### Viewing Documents

1. Navigate to `/documents` page
2. Documents load automatically with mock data
3. Use search bar to find specific documents
4. Use category tabs to filter by document type

### Uploading Documents

1. Click "Upload Document" button
2. Fill in document name, type, and university
3. Select a file (PDF, DOC, DOCX, JPG, PNG, ZIP)
4. Click "Upload Document" to add to the list

### Managing Documents

- **Download**: Click download icon to download document
- **Delete**: Click trash icon to remove document (with confirmation)

## Mock Data

The page uses realistic mock data including:

- High School Transcripts
- Test Score Reports
- Personal Statements
- Recommendation Letters
- Portfolio Files

## Future Backend Integration

When the backend API is ready, simply replace:

```typescript
import { mockDocumentApi } from "@/utils/mockDocuments";
```

With:

```typescript
import { documentApi } from "@/utils/api";
```

And update all `mockDocumentApi` calls to `documentApi`. The interface is identical.

## Development Notes

- All file uploads are simulated (no actual file storage)
- Mock delays simulate real network requests
- Data persists only during the session
- Ready for immediate backend integration
